- **Authentication**
  - Cookie authentication middleware
  - Demo login: user is authenticated if `userId == password`
- **Swagger**
  - Interactive Swagger UI for testing endpoints

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

### Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-demo-api.git
   cd employee-demo-api
   dotnet restore
   cd TalentManager
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Open http://localost:5160 or whichever port is displayed in the line similar to the one below.

```bash
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
   Now listening on: http://localhost:5160
```

3. For ETag testing in Swagger:
  - After logging in, access either GET employees endpoint.
  - Copy ETag in response and use for PUT endpoint.
  - Try using the same ETag again -> Should result in "Precondition Failed"
  - In a prod/real environment, this would mean the resourse ur trying to update has already been changed.

4. For CBAC testing on Delete Endpoint:
   - Rules for deletion are user must have "HR Manager" role (default), and must be in same department and country as user to be deleted
   - User has department = "IT" and country = "USA"
   - Deleting Employee "Delete Test" will work with rules
   - Other employees and invalid ids will return errors

For laters:
- Replace dummy login with ASP.NET Core Identity
- Add persistence layer (EF Core + SQL Server)
- Deploy to Azure App Service
